# Gesture-Recognition-LSTM-GRU-Transfer-Learning
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

- Thumbs Up: Increase the volume.
- Thumbs Down: Decrease the volume.
- Left Swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds.
- Right Swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds.
- Stop: Pause the movie.
